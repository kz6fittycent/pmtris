Poor Man's Tetris Clone 

Current status: Works great!  Recently found and fixed a huge bug with row completion.  Presently, no known bugs.

Before the promised OO rewirte, I plan to do the following:
* Make the board size configurable by command line options.
* Make it possible to flip the board (exercise my linear algebra muscles).
* Add exception handling to curses calls.
* Possibly bring back title screen.
* Add optional jumbo board and pieces.

Done
* Add slam to bottom feature, via spacebar.
* Add a save state option.
* Add verbose help for new command line opts, using optparse.
